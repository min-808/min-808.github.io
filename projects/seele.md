Seele is a Discord bot I spent Winter 2023 working on. This project helped me learn about Javascript, as well as how to structure a database schema.

Seele is implemented using [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/), a Node.js module that interacts with the Discord API very easily. Within three weeks, I created a fully-fledged bot that has an economy, various games, and a daily log-in system.

In this project I gained experience with [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, Javascript for creating the interactions, and Mongoose for creating a connection between MongoDB and the Node.js runtime environment.

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
