# My Beginnings

In my very first years of high school, I came across software engineering from my very first coding class. It was a really simple class, where we built websites, learned about the basics of CSS and JS, and had to create an interactive story on a website as our final project. I was hooked instantly. I loved how there were no boundaries and that with coding, the possibilities are just endless. I would spend hours awake past midnight perfecting my projects and researching ways to improve the clarity and structure of my code. This prompted me to take up a Computer Science major, and I've been enjoying the classes ever since.

# Building my Interests

Now that I have some coding experience as a sophomore in college, I've started to pick up a few particular interests in software engineering.

One of my projects, a Discord bot, really opened up my eyes to the side of database management. It's weird how something as simple as a database could seem interesting, but to me, I just find it fascinating how data storage and retrieval works. Using APIs to request data and parsing that data to a readable format is something that is really cool to me. It's 

```javascript
function add(first, second) {
  return first + second;
}

function add(first: number, second: number): number {
  return first + second;
}
```

In my opinion, this is what makes it better than Javascript, and I feel like it’s a very good language for people who want to learn programming. I would turn newcomers away from languages like C since they’re so complex. You must keep track of every little thing that goes on in your program, from processes like memory allocation to garbage collection. It’s easy to lose yourself in the intricacies of a fairly low-level language. This is why I feel like JS/TS is a great starting point since you don’t have to worry so much about the inner workings of the language. All the memory allocation is done for you behind the scenes and the standard library of methods is very intuitive. Additionally, I feel like after you’ve understood how to program in Typescript, it’s much easier to learn the fundamentals of programming through lower-level languages.

# Coding Under Pressure 

The professor for my ICS314 class utilizes a special learning tool called WODs (workout of the day). In these WODs, we’re required to code a solution to a problem while working under a time limit. Personally, I enjoy these challenges a lot because they simulate what a real technical interview would be like. You have to think of a solution, write the code, and debug it, all while having a ticking clock above your head. Although stressful, once the perfect solution comes to mind, it’s great seeing the code form into place and the results print out exactly what you expected. The skills I get from these WODs over the course of the semester will hopefully push my brain to work better under pressure.

# Closing Thoughts

All in all, I think I’ll come to enjoy ICS314. Typescript has been a blast to learn, and I’m excited about the final project where I’ll be able to see all my efforts come to fruition. I’m hopeful that I’ll learn a lot, and that I’ll be confident when it comes to my future in software engineering.
